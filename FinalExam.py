"""
The program will calculate and display the number of grades, the average grade, and the percentage of grades that are 
above the average grade to the user.  First we define a main function
under this main function we open the final.txt file  and assign integers to each score. 
After we have the number of scores in the txt document 
we must close the txt file. After we have all the scores read into the memory, 
we take the sum of all the scores that were in the txt file and add them up, after this we 
divide the sum by the amount of scores in the txt file in order to find the average grade. 
After we calculate the average grade, we take the scores above the average grade and divide them by the amount of 
scores that were in the finals.txt file and multiply it by 100 in order to find the percentage of scores
that were above the average grade. 
The correct answers should be as follows:
Number of grades: 24
Average grade: 83.25
Percentage of grades above average: 54.17
